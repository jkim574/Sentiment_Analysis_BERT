# Sentiment_Analysis_BERT

## Overview

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in PyTorch. The IMDB movie review dataset is used, which contains reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

### Steps
## 1. Setup and Dependencies
- Set up a Python environment with necessary libraries including PyTorch, Transformers, pandas, and seaborn.
- Check for GPU availability to leverage accelerated training and inference.

## 2.  Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load the IMDB movie review dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Visualize the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset to understand the balance.
